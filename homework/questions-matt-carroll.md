## Questions

### 1. Diversity in Investigation Journalism
I think investigative journalism in particular is considered to lack diversity among writers and editors. Do you have any insights on why that is? Or how it can be changed? (ADD LINK TO STORY)  

### 2. Becoming a data journalist
How did you become a data journalist? Was that a role that existed in the newsroom that you were specifically hired for, or did you grow into it/develop it(??????) because you were good with numbers?

### 3. Catholic Church Story
(BLOCK QUOTE ON BEYOND EXPECATIONS????maybe from robby?) What did you expect when the Spotlight team first started working on the story at the direction of Marty Barron? Were you skeptical that there was a big story there? And did you think it would be impossible to ever get any documents/information from the arhdiocese?(SP!!!!!)

### 4. Interviews on a sensitive subject
You were Spotlight's data guy, but the movie also depicts you conducting interviews with victims and their families. How did you approach those interviews, knowing the subject would likely be reluctant or have difficulty talking about their abuse. How did you and the other reporters build trust in those situations?  (ADD CLIP???)

### 5. Lessons Learned
The movie. and other reporters????, suggested that the Globe could have reported the abuse story sooner. Did that story change anything/ie: did change approach for future stories/reporting (on other topics). FIXXXXXXXX
