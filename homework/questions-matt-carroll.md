## Questions

### 1. Diversity in investigation journalism
> Today, even as ongoing racial inequality roils the national landscape, too few of the journalists doing investigative reporting come from the communities suffering the most. The ranks of investigative reporters in the nation's top newsrooms continue to be overwhelmingly white.  --from the Ida B. Wells Society website

It seems like investigative journalism in particular tends to lack diversity. Do you have any insights on why that is? Or how it can be changed?

### 2. Becoming a data journalist

![spreadsheet scene](https://github.com/courtlew/compjour-2017/blob/master/homework/Carrollspreadheet.png)

How did you become a data journalist? Was that a role that existed in the newsroom that you were specifically hired for, or did you grow into it because you were good with databases?

### 3. Initial expectations for abuse story
You wrote last year that the sex abuse story surpassed the Spotlight team's expectations:
> The outcome was far more explosive than we ever expected.

What *did* you expect when you first started working on the story? Were you skeptical that there was much that hadn't already been reported? And did you think it would be impossible to ever get any documents or information from the Catholic church?

### 4. Interviews on a sensitive subject
You were Spotlight's data specialist, but [the movie also depicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCYobpktFdU) you conducting interviews with victims and their families. How did you approach those interviews, knowing people would likely be reluctant or have difficulty talking about their abuse? How did you and the other reporters build trust in those situations?

### 5. Lessons learned
The movie and other accounts have suggested that the Globe could have reported the abuse story sooner. Did that story change anything as far as how the Spotlight team looked for or selected its stories in the future?
