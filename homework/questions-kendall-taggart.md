## Questions

### 1. Why investigative journalism?
>I moved to Boston, and I had coffee with anyone in the documentary film world— which is what I first thought I wanted to do— who would agree to meet with me. I sat down with this director who told me “we’re not hiring.” I told him, “I’ll do anything.”

Why did you switch to investigative reporting, and how did you end up at BuzzFeed?

### 2. A crime to be poor
It seems like it was accepted practice to jail people for not paying fines. How did you and the other reporters who worked on the story hear about this and recognize that it was illegal? 

### 3. Getting comments from judges
>  “I can’t just let them go because they don’t have money,” she said, adding that doing so would be “unfair to the rich person.”
There are some great and pretty defiant quotes from judges in that story. How easy or difficult was it to get them to talk to you?

### 4. Story impact
What kind of response did the traffic fines story get, and do you know if the system has changed at all since it ran? 

### 5. Longterm projects

On Shaky Ground is described as a 19-month project. Were you part of it the whole time? And how do long-term projects like that work: do you work on other things or focus totally on one project?
