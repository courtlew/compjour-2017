Can you tell us a little about the process for building the Lost and Found app?

### 2. Photos of the dead
![warning photo](https://github.com/courtlew/compjour-2017/blob/master/homework/lostandfoundcover.png)
Was there much discussion around how to handle the sensitive issue of publishing photos of the deceased? How did the team decide to do it this way?

### 3. Path to web development
You didn't study CS or engineering in college, so how did you get into development? Do you have any advice for students who are interested in building news apps or sites and don't have a CS background?

### 4. Sharing info
With projects like V3 that encourage people to share the process behind their work, have you met any resistance  or reluctance from journalists who have been conditioned to treat others as competition?

### 5. Border project
The U.S.-Mexico border has received a lot of attention and news coverage. Where did the idea come from to build this interactive focusing on the physical border?
